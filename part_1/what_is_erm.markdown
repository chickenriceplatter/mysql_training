An entity-relationship-model is a graphical representation of tables in a database.  The model shows the information that each table contains and how different tables related to each other.
There are 5 parts that make up a ERM: entities, attributes, primary keys, relationships and cardinalities.

Entities are things that you want to keep track of in a table.  An entity can be a person, place, thing or idea.  An entity will become a table in a database.

Attributes are properties that describe an entity.  Attibutes make up columns in a table.

Primary keys are an attribute or group of attributes that uniquely identify an instance of an entity.

Relationships describe how entities interact with each other.

Cardinalities are constraints defining the number of instances that are necessary in a relationship.  Cardinalities are modeled using crow's foot notation.
